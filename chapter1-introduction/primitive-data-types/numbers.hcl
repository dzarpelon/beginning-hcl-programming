# All number data types are base 10 by default and can be integer or float
first = 10 # integer
second = 10.56 # float

# We can use hexadecimal, octal, scientific notations:

## Hexadecimals MUST start with prefix 0x, the below hexadecimal is equivalent to "30" in decimal
hexadecimal = 0x1E 

## Octals MUST start with prefix 0, the below octal is equivalent to "7" in decimal
octal = 07 

# Scientific format uses "1e10" for example the below scientific means "2 times 10 to the power of 15"
scientific = 2e15
