# A tuple is an ordered collection of elements that can be of different types.  A list on the other hand, can have only the same type of elements.
# Here's an example of tuple:

array_test = ["first",2,"third"] # has two strings and one integer

# below we have a boolean, a multiline string and a single line string
test_array = [
    true,
    << ERRDOC
    Hello
    Array
    ERRDOC ,
    "Test"
]
