#### Naming conventions

- A name must begin with a letter or an underscore
- The name continues with letters, numbers or underscores
- Go is case sensitive

#### Variables

basic syntax is ```var <name><type> = <value``` like in the examples below:

```
var s string
var maximum strong
var number int
```
- Go is able to determine the type of variable (string, bool and so on). So no need to declare those.

#### Pointers

A pointer is the address of the memory used to store the value of a variable or is the address of the variable.

With pointers we can change the value of a variable without directly assigning it to the variable.

Pointers work directly on the memory assigned to the variable.
